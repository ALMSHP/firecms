You can use FireCMS with Next.js. FireCMS is a React library, so you can use it with any React
framework.

In the case of Next.js, you are restricted to running FireCMS on the client side,
as Next.js does not support server side rendering of some of the React components used by FireCMS.

Let's build an app using FireCMS and Next.js, with the app router configured to delegate
all the routes starting with `/cms` to FireCMS.

### Create a Next.js project

Start by creating your Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Select:
- `TypeScript` as the language
- `ESLint` as the linter
- `Tailwind CSS` as the CSS framework
- `src` as the root directory
- Yes to the app router prompt
- Yes to customize the default import alias (optional)

### Install FireCMS

Then we are going to install FireCMS PRO. Note that we will not be adding all the plugins like the collection
editor or data enhancement, but you can add them as needed.

Then install FireCMS and its dependencies:

```bash
yarn add firebase@^10 @firecms/core@^3.0.0-beta @firecms/firebase@^3.0.0-beta @firecms/editor@^3.0.0-beta react-router@^6 react-router-dom@^6 @tailwindcss/typography typeface-rubik @fontsource/jetbrains-mono
```

Now let's import the tailwind config of FireCMS. Add the FireCMS preset `tailwind.config.js`, as well as the
content paths to FireCMS source code, so the right tailwind classes are picked.

```js
import fireCMSConfig from "@firecms/ui/tailwind.config.js";
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

const config: Config = {
  presets: [fireCMSConfig],
  content: [
    "./src/pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/cms/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./node_modules/@firecms/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
  ]
};
export default config;

```

### Disable yarn pnp (optional)

We prefer disabling yarn pnp for this project. You can do this by creating the file `.yarnrc` in the root of your project
with the following content:

```bash
nodeLinker: node-modules
```



### Configuring the App router

Next.js uses a file based router. In this guide, we will be creating the FireCMS
app in the `/cms` route, but you can customize this to your needs.

FireCMS uses react-router, so we need to configure Next.js to delegate
all the routes starting with `/cms` to FireCMS.

In our `app` folder, we create a folder called `cms` and inside it another one called
`[[...path]]`. This will match any route starting with `/cms`.

Then create the file `cms/[[...path]]/page.tsx` with the following content:
:::important
If you are not running FireCMS in the root path of you app, you need to set the `basePath` prop to the path where you
are running it. In this case, we are running it in `/cms`.
:::

```tsx
"use client";
import { FireCMSApp } from "@/cms/FireCMSApp";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

export default function CMS() {
    return <BrowserRouter basename={"/cms"}>
        <FireCMSApp/>
    </BrowserRouter>;
}

```

### Creating the CMS

Now let's create the FireCMS components. Create the file `./src/cms/FireCMSApp.tsx` with the following content.
Remember to replace the `firebaseConfig` with your own Firebase configuration.


import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import MyComponentSource from "!!raw-loader!../../samples/samples_v3/nextjs.tsx";

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>


### Import the default FireCMS styles
Create a file called `index.css` in the `./src/cms` folder with the following content:

```css
@import "@firecms/ui/index.css";
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

:root {
    --fcms-primary: #0070F4;
    --fcms-primary-dark: #0061e6;
    --fcms-primary-bg: #0061e610;
    --fcms-secondary: #FF5B79;
}

a {
    @apply text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800
}
```

## Run

Then simply run:

```
yarn dev
```
