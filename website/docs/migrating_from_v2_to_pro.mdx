FireCMS 3.0 is a major release that introduces a lot of changes. This page
describes the main changes and how to migrate from FireCMS 2.0.

:::important
FireCMS PRO is now feature complete and available for self-hosting.
You can still use the hosted version of FireCMS, now called FireCMS Cloud.
:::


FireCMS PRO is the self-hosted version of FireCMS. It allows you to host your own backend and use FireCMS without any restrictions.
It is the most similar version to FireCMS 2.0, but with a lot of improvements and new features.

## Migrating to FireCMS PRO

Most of the concepts are the same as in FireCMS 2.0, but there are some changes that you need to be aware of.
We recommend starting a new project with:
```bash
yarn create firecms-app --pro
```
or
```bash
npx create-firecms-app --pro
```

This will create a new project with the latest version of FireCMS PRO.
