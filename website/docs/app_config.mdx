The app config is the main configuration object of FireCMS Cloud. It is defined
by the interface `FireCMSAppConfig`. In order to customize the CMS, you need
to create a project in [app.firecms.co](https://app.firecms.co) and
initialise a new project in code with `npx create-firecms-app` or `yarn create firecms-app`.

After those steps are ready you can use the `FireCMSAppConfig` export to add
your own customizations, like custom reusable properties or fields, collections,
entity views, cms views, etc.


### Customization options

Let's see all the customization options available:

* `collections`: List of the mapped collections in the CMS.
    Each entry relates to a collection in the root database.
    Each of the navigation entries in this field
    generates an entry in the main menu.
    See [Collections](./collections) for more information.

* `views`: Custom additional views created by the developer, added to the main navigation.
    See [Custom top level views](./custom_top_level_views) for more information.

* `propertyConfigs`: List of custom property configs to be used in the CMS.
    You can use the key to reference the custom field in the `propertyConfig` prop of a property in a collection.
    See [Property configs](./properties/reusing_properties) for more information.

* `entityViews`: List of additional custom views for entities.
    You can use the key to reference the custom view in the `entityViews` prop of a collection.
    You can also define an entity view from the UI.
    See [Entity views](./collections/entity_views) for more information.

* `HomePage`: Use this component to override the home page.
* `fireCMSAppBarComponentProps`: Additional props passed to the custom AppBar.
* `firestoreIndexesBuilder`: Use this builder to indicate which indexes are available in your Firestore database.
    This is used to allow filtering and sorting for multiple fields in the CMS.
* `onFirebaseInit`: Optional callback after Firebase has been initialised.
    Useful for using the local emulator or retrieving the used configuration.
* `dateTimeFormat`: Format of the dates in the CMS.
    Defaults to 'MMMM dd, yyyy, HH:mm:ss'.
* `locale`: Locale of the CMS, currently only affecting dates.
* `textSearchController`: Use this controller to return text search results as document ids, that get then fetched from Firestore.
* `autoOpenDrawer`: Experimental feature to open the drawer automatically when hovering.
* `appCheck`: Firebase App Check configuration.
    - `provider`: The provider to use for App Check.
    - `isTokenAutoRefreshEnabled`: Whether to automatically refresh the token.
    - `debugToken`: Debug token to use for App Check.
    - `forceRefresh`: Whether to force refresh the token.
