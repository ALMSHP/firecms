FireCMS has a high quality set of components that you can use to build your own custom views.
You can use them in your own React applications or in your own CMS views.
All the components are exported from the `@firecms/ui` package.

The components are primarily built using Radix UI primitives and tailwindcss. This means that you can easily customize them
using tailwindcss or even override the styles using CSS.
