The new version of FireCMS is a major release that brings a lot of new features
and improvements. This page will guide you through the most important changes ðŸ”¥

FireCMS 3.0 now makes use of a backend to provide a more flexible and
customizable experience.

Until now, FireCMS was a frontend-only library that would connect directly to
the client-side Firebase SDK. This was great for simple use cases, but it
limited the flexibility of the library. For example, it was not possible to
customize collections from the UI, since they were hard coded in the clients
code.

Having a backend allows us to store configuration in Firestore, and to make it easy for end users
to modify the schemas. We have done a lot of work to **prevent polluting your database** with
FireCMS' configuration.

Having a backend also allows us to provide a better experience by offering additional features
such as data enhancement through OpenAPI GPT-4.


## New UI collection schema editor

Until now, the collection schema was defined in the client-side code. This was
great for simple use cases, but it limited the flexibility of the library. For
example, it was not possible to customize collections from the UI, since they
were hard coded in the clients code.

Now **the collection schema is stored in FireCMS backend**, (no worries, you can still
use the old way if you want to). Your end users will be able to modify the
collection schema. Let's say you have a collection of `Posts` and you want to
add a new possible value for the enum `status`. You can now open the collection
editor and add the new value. Even better, FireCMS can find new values and add
them to your schema with one click!

### New data inference

Do you have a few collections in your project and you want to get started
quickly? FireCMS can now **infer the schema from your data**. This means that
you can get started with FireCMS in a few minutes, without having to write a
single line of code.

## Data import and export

### Export
You now have better control of how your data is **exported**:
- Define the format of your timestamps
- Define how arrays get serialized in CSV files (assign one column per array item, or
serialize the array as a string)
- Export your data as JSON or CSV.

### Import
You can now **import data** from CSV, JSON or Excel files. This is great for migrating data
from other systems. We incorporate a modern UI that allows to define how the data is imported
and how it is mapped to your collections.

## Tailwind migration and performance improvements

Versions 1.0 and 2.0 of FireCMS were based on Material UI (mui). This was great
for getting started quickly, but it had some drawbacks. The main one was that
**performance was not great**. The styling solution of MUI is based on emotion
which resolves styles at runtime. This means that the browser has to do a lot of
work to resolve the styles. This is not a problem for small applications, but
it can be a problem for large applications.

In FireCMS 3.0 we have migrated to Tailwind CSS. This is a utility-first CSS
framework that allows us to generate a small CSS file with all the styles
resolved at build time. This means that the browser does not have to do any
work to resolve the styles, which results in a **much faster experience**. ðŸš€
