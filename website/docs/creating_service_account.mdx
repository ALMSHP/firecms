You **only** need to create a service account manually for FireCMS Cloud projects, in case you don't want
to grant FireCMS admin permissions. In the app, you can create new or link to existing projects
without the need to create a service account manually.
:::

One possible way to create a FireCMS Cloud project and link it to your **existing** Firebase/GCP project is by creating
a service account, assigning the necessary permissions, and linking it to your project.

In order to do so please follow these steps:

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

- Select the project you want to link to FireCMS.

- Go to the [Service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) section.

- Click on the `Create Service Account` button.

- Fill in the details for the service account. Name it `FireCMS`.

- Assign the following roles:
     - `Firebase Admin`
     - `Firebase Admin SDK Administrator Service Agent`
     - `Firebase Service Management Service Agent`

- Optionally, define the users that can impersonate the service account.

- Now let's create the JSON key that will be uploaded to FireCMS Cloud.
Find the newly created Service account, and in the dropdown menu, click on `Manage keys`.

- Then create new key

- And finally, download the JSON key.

Now you can **upload this JSON key** to **FireCMS Cloud** and link it to your project.
