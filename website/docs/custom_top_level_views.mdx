If you need to develop a custom view that does not map directly to a Firestore
collection you can implement it as a React component.

You need to define the name, route and the component, and add it to the main
navigation, as the example below.

By default, it will show in the main navigation view.

For custom views you can define the following props:

* `path` string

  CMS Path you can reach this view from.
  If you include multiple paths, only the first one will be included in the
  main menu

* `name`: string

  Name of this view

* `description`?: string

  Optional description of this view. You can use Markdown

* `hideFromNavigation`?: boolean

  Should this view be hidden from the main navigation panel.
  It will still be accessible if you reach the specified path

* `view`: React.ReactNode

  Component to be rendered. This can be any React component, and can use any
  of the provided hooks

* `group`?: string

  Optional field used to group top level navigation entries under a
  navigation view.


### Example:
A quick example for a custom view:


import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import CustomViewSampleApp from "!!raw-loader!../samples/samples_v3/custom_cms_view/CustomViewSampleApp";
import ExampleCMSView from "!!raw-loader!../samples/samples_v3/custom_cms_view/ExampleCMSView";

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{CustomViewSampleApp}</CodeBlock>


Your custom view is implemented as any regular React component that uses
some hooks provided by the CMS:



<CodeBlock language="tsx">{ExampleCMSView}</CodeBlock>
