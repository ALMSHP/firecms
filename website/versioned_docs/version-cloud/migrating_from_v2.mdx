FireCMS 3.0 is a major release that introduces a lot of changes. This page
describes the main changes and how to migrate from FireCMS 2.0.

FireCMS 3.0 now makes use of a backend to provide a more flexible and
customizable experience.

Until now, FireCMS was a frontend-only library that would connect directly to
the client-side Firebase SDK. This was great for simple use cases, but it
limited the flexibility of the library. For example, it was not possible to
customize collections from the UI, since they were hard coded in the clients
code.

Having a backend allows us to store configuration in Firestore, and to make it easy for end users
to modify the schemas. We have done a lot of work to **prevent polluting your database** with
FireCMS' configuration.

Having a backend also allows us to provide a better experience by offering additional features
such as data enhancement through OpenAPI GPT-4.
