FireCMS 3.0 is the latest version of FireCMS. You can either use it as a
**self-hosted** solution or as a **fully managed service**. In both cases, you
can use the same codebase and the same configuration.

:::tip NEW
FireCMS Cloud is the hosted version of FireCMS. It is a **fully managed
service** that allows you to **create and manage your content** in a
**user-friendly interface**.

With FireCMS Cloud you can visualize and edit your Firestore data in a friendly
interface, **without writing a single line of code**.
:::

**But** you still can upload your own code and define your custom properties,
views, etc. in both the self-hosted and the hosted version of FireCMS.

## Features

- **Fully managed service**. No need to worry about infrastructure, security,
scalability or maintenance.
- **User-friendly interface**. FireCMS Cloud provides a user-friendly interface
to visualize and edit your Firestore data.
- **Collection editor**. Create and edit your collections and documents in a
friendly interface. No need to write a single line of code.
- **Users and roles**. Create users and roles to manage access to your data.


## Getting started

You can use FireCMS Cloud with your existing Firestore project, or let it create
a new one for you.

Just sign up and start using it!

    Go to FireCMS Cloud
</a>

After you have created your FireCMS 3 project, you can either use it directly or customize it
by uploading your own code.




## Current limitations

Compared to the self-hosted version of FireCMS, FireCMS Cloud has the following
limitation: **No custom code**. You cannot add custom code to your CMS. This includes
custom fields, custom views, custom routes, custom authentication, etc.

This is a limitation that we are working on removing in the future. If you are
interested in this feature, please let us know your use case in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/fxy7xsQm3m)
