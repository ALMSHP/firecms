> for developers.

FireCMS Cloud is the hosted version of FireCMS. It is a **fully managed
service** that allows you to **create and manage your content** in a
**user-friendly interface**.

With FireCMS Cloud you can visualize and edit your Firestore data in a friendly
interface, **without writing a single line of code**.

## Features

- **Fully managed service**. No need to worry about infrastructure, security,
  scalability or maintenance.
- **User-friendly interface**. FireCMS Cloud provides a user-friendly interface
  to visualize and edit your Firestore data.
- **Collection editor**. Create and edit your collections and documents in a
  friendly interface. No need to write a single line of code.
- **Users and roles**. Create users and roles to manage access to your data.

## Current limitations

Compared to the self-hosted version of FireCMS, FireCMS Cloud has the following
limitation: **No custom code**. You cannot add custom code to your CMS. This includes
custom fields, custom views, custom routes, custom authentication, etc.

This is a limitation that we are working on removing in the future. If you are
interested in this feature, please let us know your use case in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/fxy7xsQm3m)
or at hello@firecms.co
